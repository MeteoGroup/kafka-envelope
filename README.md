kafka-envelope
==============

Kafka messages per-se do not have any mean to carry generic metadata.
This project defines a message metadata format on top of Kafka using
Protobuf3 for envelop serialization and deserialization.

While being implemented in Java the wide availability of Protobuf makes
it easy to create implementations in other languages.


How to build
------------

```
mvn clean verify
```

A local installation of `protoc` is _not_ required.


How to install
--------------

To add the artifact to your local maven repository run
